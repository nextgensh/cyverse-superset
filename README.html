<h1 id="ua-cyverse-superset">UA Cyverse Superset</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-apache-superset-and-what-can-it-be-used-for">What is
Apache Superset and what can it be used for?</h2>
<p>Superset is no-code visualization framework that offers users the
following options</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create interactive dashboard.</li>
<li>Pick from a wide range of charts without writing a single line of
code.</li>
<li>Provides an interactive SQL editor as part of SQL Lab.</li>
<li>Save, share and view recent queries.</li>
<li>Connect to wide range of databases including AWS Athena. A complete
list can be found <a
href="https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers">here</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Superset acts as thin layer between your data source and the
visualization dashboards. Hence it can process large quantities of data,
limited only by the database backend chosen. You can read more about
Superset in the <a
href="https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro">official
documentation.</a></p>
<h2
id="how-is-this-different-from-the-standard-superset-docker-build">How
is this different from the standard superset docker build?</h2>
<p>This build has been adapted to run on UA Cyverse with the following
modifications</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>SQLlite is set to be the default database to store metadata for
superset (this is where all the connection data, graphs and dashboards
is saved).</li>
<li>The original docker build for superset spins up a separate container
for each service - redis cache, postgresql database for metastore,
websocket for async communication, and superset app. We are limited to a
single container on Cyverse. Hence in memory cache support with redis
has been droped. Postgresql has been switched out for sqlite. Websocket
support has been droped. This build is meant only for data exploration
in a research setting, not for running in production.</li>
<li>A periodic cron job (every 5 minutes) is responsible for copying the
local sqlite database into <code>superset-sqlite</code> inside the users
cyverse home folder. This allows for the application data to remain
persistent even after restarts.</li>
<li>During startup the app checks inside <code>superset-sqlite</code> to
check if a database file exists. If it does then charts, users and
dashboard from it are loaded.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-i-start-this-app-in-cyverse">How do I start this app in
Cyverse?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to cyverse discovery environment.</li>
<li>On the top left dropdown pick <code>Browse All Apps</code></li>
<li>Look for an app named <code>sensorfabric-superset</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively you can also use the search bar on the top in discovery
environment and search for <code>sensorfabric-superset</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-launch-the-app">How do I launch the app?</h2>
<p>Click on the application to get started. You will then be taken to
the quick launch wizard.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Give a name to your analysis and pick an output folder (you can
leave these as default)</li>
<li>Fill up the analysis parameters in the next screen. <strong>If you
plan to reuse this instance of superset make to store these parameters
securely as they will be needed to resume all your dashboards and
login</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Admin Username - Each superset instance sets up a default admin
user. This is the username for it. You will need it to login.</li>
<li>Admin Password - Password for your admin account.</li>
<li>Secret Key - The local database stored in your home folder is
encrypted using this key. We recommend setting a key that is atleast
alphanumeric and 42 characters long. Longer the better! If you are on
Linux, Mac or inside WSL in windows you can generate a random secret
using <code>openssl rand -base64 42</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Resource Requirements - You can leave this default. If you plan to
render compute expensive graphs you might want to give yourself more CPU
cores for rendering.</li>
<li>(optional) You can save your parameters for a saved launch in the
next step. This will allow to quickly launch the instance again to reuse
your charts, and won’t have to keep entering the same paramters over and
over again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="are-we-done">Are we done?</h2>
<p>Yes! Click on <code>goto analysis</code>. The application could take
sevral minutes to launch to launch. You can always come to it from the
analysis section. You will see a sign in screen. Once you enter your
credentials (you setup during the launch) you should be able to login
into superset.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-find-the-local-database-file">Where do I find the
local database file?</h2>
<p>Every 5 minutes the app automatically stores the local database file
into <code>/iplant/home/[cyverse_username]/superset-sqlite</code>.
<strong>DANGER-</strong>Anyone you share this file with along with the
launch parameters will have full access to your dashboards, and database
keys. Please be careful who you share this with. Because this file is
automatically synced, we recommend waiting at least 5 minutes before
terminating your analysis from the time you have made any change.</p>
<h2 id="resuming-were-you-left-off">Resuming were you left off</h2>
<p>If you want to resume your previous dashboard, just start the app
again using the exact same parameters you used initially to launch
it.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-can-share-my-dashboards-with-other-cyverse-users">How
can I can share my dashboards with other cyverse users?</h2>
<p>If you share the databse file
<code>superset-sqlite/superset.db</code> with other cyverse users along
with launch parameters, they can access your dashbaords.</p>
<h2
id="someone-shared-their-database-file-with-me-how-do-i-resume-from-it">Someone
shared their database file with me, how do I resume from it?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add this file inside
<code>/iplant/home/[cyverse_username]/superset-sqlite</code></li>
<li>Launch the app with the same launch parameters as those used by the
original user when the dashboards were made.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-i-connect-to-aws-athena-database-for-sensorfabric">How do
I connect to AWS Athena database for sensorfabric?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Log into superset.</li>
<li>Click on <code>settings</code> in the top right.</li>
<li>Click on <code>database connections</code>.</li>
<li>Click on <code>+ Database</code> to add a new database
connection.</li>
<li>If you are using sensorfabric select <code>Amazon Athena</code> from
the <code>Supported Databases</code> dropdown.</li>
<li>Change the name to your liking.</li>
<li>If using sensorfabric the <code>SQLALCHEMY URI</code> would have
been shared with you securely using UA Stache. <strong>Never store this
locally on your laptop or right it down.</strong></li>
<li>Click on <code>Connect</code> and you are all set.</li>
</ol>
